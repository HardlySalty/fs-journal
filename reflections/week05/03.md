## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?
    - It is a given time from oneself that serves as a deadline for a certain assignment or section of an assignment how ever you wish to use that.

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?
  - A give myself a time frame that I believe that I can do the project within
  - Then try to challenge myself and to complete it faster than what I predicted.
  - If I do so then reward myself with whatever that may be.

3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how? 
  - Well since I am doing this journal after the Hackathon I can say my group had put a time limit on our project of 12PM and we ended up comlpeting everything we set out to do by 11PM.
  - But in the past tense of when I probably could have used it is really for every Lab or Checkpoint we have done I believe if I had done this I probably would have been more focused and had the assignment done a lot quicker.
