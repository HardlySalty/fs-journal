## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 
  - To allow you to create a rough-draft of what you intend to design so that you are able to "create" your website really fast then do your final draft and actually code it out

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
- 1:) low fidelity is very quick you just kinda throw stuff out and dont pay really any attention to scaling or to making anything perfect.
- 2:) high fidelity is designing exactly what you wish making everything perfect creating all the images and putting them on the page. making everything pixel perfect, ect which obviously takes the most time out of the three
- 3:) mid fidelity is somewhere in between low and high fidelity creating what you want but not making everything perfect but good enough like throwing random pictures that are gonna somwhat resemble what you are gonna put there when you actually code it out. aligning things somewhat rougly where you want. this is somewhat time consuming but gives you a good idea of what you are gonna run into aswell as what you really dont like.

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?
- I'd say defintly especially since a lot of the times you start doing something and it just isnt what you truly invisioned so you redo it and then at that point your already maybe 3, 4, 5 hours in maybe in longer and you would already have known this if you would have just spent maybe 40 minutes just wire-framing it out.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
- working with Ryan tought me a lot in the idea of explaining my thoughts I felt like after today I can actually explain what im thinking relativly well. as well as having two minds is really helpful so that you can bounce ideas of one another and since Ryan and I are both profectionist it went slow just due to us wanting to to it properly but due to that I also learned a lot and I believe that we did everything correctly and well.
