## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?
    - value type stores a value whether that is a string or an int ect.
    - refrence type stores a value of another variable or a refrence of another variable.
    - pointer type stores a return value 

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?
    - bool, byte, char, decimal, double, enum, float, int, long I definitly didnt just copy the list but here are some of them... The difference is that JS can store any data within a variable with let or const while in C# you must define what you are going to be storing within a variable.

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?
    - It stores the location of the variable.
    - Value type rather than storing a locotion it stores the data like the example shows in that location it stores 100.
