## Questions

1. What is a List in C#?
    - A list in C# is an array or data like a JS array except in C# you have to define what you are going to be storing within the array

2. What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?
    - I can see a use case for all of them but I believe the .find method will probably be most used so that when i store data I am able to retrieve it :D

3. How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?
    - Im not reading the next question it just so happened to be like this but the .find method :P
