## Questions

    - unit testing, component testing, end to end testing.

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?
    - end to end seems to be the most useful just due the fact it can test more.

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?
    - When it comes down to it I think they all have their use cases like said previously they all have their tradeoffs but if i had to say one unit testing is probably the least useful just due to you cant get as much info like you can from the others.
