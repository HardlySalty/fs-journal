> **ðŸ“– [The Observer Pattern](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk3/04-Observer-Pattern)**

## Questions

1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?
    - I believe that it seeks to solve the DRY principle and make code more reusable so with that it also helps to follow the SOLID principles.

2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?
    - The subscribe method => Subject: maintains a list of its dependants called observers, and it notifies them automatically of any changes to the state.
    - The unsubscibe method => Observer: provides an update interface for objects that should be notified of changes in a subject.
    - The broadcast method=> ConcreteSubject: broadcasts notifications to observers on changes of its state, usually by calling the update method of each observer.
    - With further research into this I found that the Subject, Observer, and ConcreteSubject are more common names for this makes me curious of why you guys called them different names???

3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.
    - If i am understanding the question correctly you are talking about the utils within the template.. If so then my answer is this! Most of the utils grabs properties from elements within the dom then changes those properties and "saves" them until the page is reloaded unless its actually saved.
    - As well as some of the Utils create elements to the page like the pop element with preset properties to choose from like the icon, or the title which is expecting a string and then sends all that to the dom until the promise is returned
    here =>
    if (required && !res.isConfirmed) {
        return await this.prompt(title)
      }
