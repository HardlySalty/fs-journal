## Questions

1. What are the two common operations that we will set in the handler?
    - get and set
2. What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to ensure the value does not become `undefined`?
    - If I am understanding correctly I believe what we would have to do is to make sure that we pass in the object itself and the value being changed

3. What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?
    - I think the biggest benefit is for security making sure that the values that are being passed in are the values expected. rather than malicious content.
