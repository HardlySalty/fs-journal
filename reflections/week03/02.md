## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?
    - to help prevent bugs
    - this section is copied pasted but my own words are below
     {
        Avoid shared mutable state. “Nondeterminism = parallel processing + mutable state” — Martin Odersky, designer of the Scala programming language
        
        “Program to an interface, not an implementation.” — Gang of Four, “Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object Oriented Software”

        “A small change in requirements should necessitate a correspondingly small change in the software.” — N. D. Birrell, M. A. Ould, “A Practical Handbook for Software Development”
        Idiomatic Encapsulation in JavaScript
    }
    - as a whole i think Encapsulation really helps to follow yes the principles above but the SOLID principles and the DRY principle.

2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?
    - from what I gathered from the article. The main problem is that it gave people a false sense of security within their "Private" functions aswell as it leads to a lot of bugs...

3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?
    - use the "#" symbol for example: #example = "example"
