## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?
  - A good plan is like your foundation more than likely you start just "building" your project its likely to fall apart

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck? 
  - I look it up on google look throught the docs on a rare occation i use ChatGPT then if that fails I ask a TA

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?
  - I think just as a whole its very common to not remember every single method to exsist. 
  It's okay to google and use resources to figure things out.
  - Another take away is it's a very good Idea to write out what you are going to be working on, before starting so that you have a good Idea of what it is that you are trying to do.
