## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.
- Console.log() is the mainly used way to write to the console you can use this when you are trying to debug a 
  piece of code that isnt doing what you want it to but also isn't throwing any errors
- Console.error() can be used as a warning or as a reminder like hey this function hasnt been completed yet
2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?
  - Elements You are able to see and edit the code directly in the elements tab so that you can see what happens on a live page (basically its just a lot faster than saving then reloading)
3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?
  - Well I think its a little case to case dependent but if you are not wanting to use console.log you can use breakpoints which allows you to see what happens when a function is called.
