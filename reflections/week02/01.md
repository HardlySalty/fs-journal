## Questions

1. What is Scope ?
  - Scope is basically what everything can see for example a let within {} cant be seen outside of it.

2. What is Hoisting ?
- It is where functions and variables are moved to the top of their scope

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?
- let is a variable that can be changed so the use case for this is 99% of the time
- const is a variable that cannot be changed so the use case for this is when you dont want the value to be changed anywhere down the line
- var is a variable that can be seen globally so generally now the use case is 0 due to the danger of possible multiple uses
