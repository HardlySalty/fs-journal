## Questions

1. What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?
    - Inheritance accomplishes code reuse. It allows us to create a base class that contains the common properties and methods of a group of classes. Then we can create child classes that inherit the properties and methods of the base class. This allows us to create a new class without having to rewrite the code for the properties and methods that are already written in the base class.

2. How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?
    - Member inheritance works by using the `: base()` syntax. This allows us to inherit all of the members of the base class. We can also override the base class members by creating a new member with the same name in the child class. This will override the base class member.

3. How does accessibility affect inheritance?
    - Accessibility affects inheritance by determining which members of the base class can be inherited by the child class. If a member is marked as `private` it cannot be inherited by the child class. If a member is marked as `protected` it can only be inherited by the child class and any classes that inherit from the child class. If a member is marked as `public` it can be inherited by any class.
