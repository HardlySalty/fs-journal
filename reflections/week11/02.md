## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`
  - A primary key is a unique identifier for a row in a table. A foreign key is a column in a table that references the primary key of another table.

2. What is an `Alias`?
  - An alias is a temporary name for a table or column. It is used to make the query easier to read.

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

```
SELECT
doctors.*
patients.*
FROM patients
JOIN doctors ON doctors.id = patients.doctorId;
```
